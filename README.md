    Terminal Emulator  
        Support for SSH, serial (RS232), and direct shell access with session persistence across reconnects.  
        Tabbed interface for managing multiple sessions.  
        Copy/paste functionality and terminal theming.
    SSH Integration  
        Connect to remote servers via SSH (password/key-based auth, tunneling support).  
        Save/load connection profiles (host, port, credentials).
    Serial Console  
        Detect local serial devices (e.g., /dev/cuau0 on FreeBSD).  
        Configure baud rate, parity, and flow control.
    Direct Shell Access  
        Execute OPNsense CLI commands (e.g., pluginctl, configctl).  
        Restrict access based on user roles (e.g., "root" vs "admin").
    Quick Commands  
        Provide pre-defined, frequently used CLI commands (e.g., ifconfig, pfctl) via a dropdown or hotkeys.
    Security  
        Role-based access control (RBAC) via OPNsense permissions.  
        Session encryption (AES-256), inactivity timeouts, and emergency session termination.  
        Input validation/sanitization to prevent command injection.
    Audit Logging  
        Log terminal activity (commands, connections) to /var/log/terminal_plugin.log.  
        Integrate with OPNsense’s Syslog/Reporting system.

3. Technical Requirements

    Platform: OPNsense 23.7+ (FreeBSD 13.2+).  
    Languages: PHP (MVC), JavaScript (xterm.js), Shell.  
    Dependencies:  
        PHP: ssh2 (>= 1.3), posix, pcntl extensions; fallback to exec() if ssh2 unavailable.  
        JavaScript: xterm.js (>= 5.0), xterm-addon-fit, xterm-addon-web-links.  
        FreeBSD: comms/putty (for serial support).
    Resource Limits: Configurable max CPU/memory per session (e.g., 10% CPU, 512MB RAM).

4. Development Steps

    Environment Setup  
        Install OPNsense dev tools (os-devel) and configure a local OPNsense VM for testing.  
        Clone OPNsense plugin template:  
        bash

        git clone https://github.com/opnsense/plugin-template.git os-terminal  

    MVC Structure  
        Model:  
            TerminalConnection (handles SSH/serial configs).  
            ShellCommand (sanitizes/executes CLI commands).
        View:  
            terminal.volt (HTML/CSS for xterm.js integration).
        Controller:  
            TerminalController (manages sessions and permissions).
    SSH Client Implementation  
        Use PHP’s ssh2_connect() with error handling:  
        php

        $connection = ssh2_connect('host', 22);  
        if (!$connection || !ssh2_auth_pubkey_file($connection, 'user', '/path/to/pub', '/path/to/priv')) {  
            throw new Exception("SSH connection failed");  
        }  

    Serial Console  
        Use proc_open() for secure serial access:  
        php

        $descriptor = ['pipe', 'r', 'pipe', 'w', 'pipe', 'w'];  
        $process = proc_open("cu -l /dev/cuau0 -s 9600", $descriptor, $pipes);  

    UI Integration  
        Embed xterm.js with accessibility:  
        javascript

        const term = new Terminal({ screenReaderMode: true });  
        term.open(document.getElementById('terminal-container'));  
        term.element.setAttribute('aria-label', 'Terminal Emulator');  

    Security Implementation  
        Validate user roles via OPNsense’s AuthGroup class.  
        Sanitize inputs using escapeshellarg().  
        Sandbox shell processes for added isolation.

5. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests  
        Validate SSH/serial connection handling (e.g., malformed keys, missing devices).  
        Test shell command sanitization.
    Integration Tests  
        Verify UI responsiveness with 50+ concurrent sessions.  
        Test RBAC policies (e.g., deny "user" role root access).
    Security Audit  
        Penetration testing and fuzzing for command injection vulnerabilities.  
        Validate session encryption (TLS 1.3+, AES-256).

6. Deployment

    Packaging  
        Build plugin using OPNsense’s pkg-create tool and test against stable/rolling releases.
    Documentation  
        Write a user guide with setup, troubleshooting, and FAQ sections (e.g., "SSH key not working").
    Community Submission  
        Submit to OPNsense’s GitHub repo under plugins/terminal.

7. Risks & Mitigation

    Risk: SSH library incompatibility.
    Mitigation: Test with multiple PHP versions (e.g., 7.4, 8.1).  
    Risk: Privilege escalation via shell access.
    Mitigation: Restrict commands via sudoers and sandbox shell processes.  
    Risk: Resource exhaustion from too many sessions.
    Mitigation: Implement a configurable session limit (e.g., max 20 sessions per user).
